# Advent Of Code 2024 - Haskell

https://adventofcode.com/2024

## Goal

Starting with no knowledge of Haskell, build my knowledge and solve the AoC2024 puzzles

in AoC, each day there is a two part problem, the second part extend the first one and can bring some challenging complexity problem

all functional, no loop, I use map or set whenever I need a grid

I put in bold the most interesting puzzles

## Days

- day01: easy
- day02: easy
- day03: regexp
- day04: first grid
- day05: easy
- day06: grid, loop detection 
- day07: leveraging functional feature for genericity
- day08: easy
- day09: bit more complex, lot of recursivity
- day10: easy
- day11: bit more complex, exponential complexity, brute force approach not working
- day12: grid, the computation of the fences on the 2nd part is interesting
- day13: could have been fun, but my first implementation was already fit for the task
- day14: grid, 2nd part has an interesting pattern detection, it forced me to print the grid
- **day15**: grid, kind of Sokoban logic to implement, the 2nd part was quite a pain
- day16: grid, first exploration algorithm
- **day17**: cpu simulation, the 2nd part forced me to use excel which helped me to understand how to resolve
- day18: grid, simple exploration algorithm
- **day19**: easy but the complexity explode if not handled correctly
- **day20**: grid, exploration algorithm, in the 2nd part the possibilities explode and require a different approach
- **day21**: the most difficult one in my opinion, 1st part is tough, 2nd part is crazy. I did it in 3 different attempts. 1st attempt would have taken years of computation, 2nd attempt should have taken a day of computation, 3rd took 15ms...
- day22: easy first part, but for the second part, I brute forced my way... it took a night of computation
- day23: easy
- **day24**: binary gate logic, first part is easy, the second part is **wow** I've handled it with excel by reverse engineering
- day25: easy
